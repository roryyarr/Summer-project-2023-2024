"""
    struct Mesh

Represents a mesh structure used in the Virtual Element Method (VEM).

# Fields:
- `boundary::Vector{Int64}`: A vector containing the indices of boundary vertices.
- `elements::Vector{Vector{Int64}}`: A vector of vectors where each inner vector represents an element (e.g., triangle or polygon) by the indices of its vertices.
- `vertices::Vector{Tuple{Float64, Float64}}`: A vector of tuples where each tuple represents the coordinates (x, y) of a vertex.

This struct is essential for defining the geometric domain in VEM computations.
